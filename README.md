A basic implementation of a Refresh Tokens system.

## Introduction

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) have proven to be useful in the design of modern web apps. They allow a user or client to access a service by attaching this token to their requests. The service then evaluates if the token is valid and decide if access should be granted to a specific endpoint of the service.

One of the characteristics of JWT is that they have an expiration date. When the JWT expires, the user needs to request a new JWT to keep accessing the service. This works well in web applications since the user usually keeps their credentials stored in the browser and can easily log in again and get a new JWT in the process. But in mobile apps, this is not a common pattern. You don't usually log out and log in again after a time has passed in your app. To achieve this, another type of token is usually issued to help your app get a new JWT automatically after one has expired. These tokens are called Refresh Tokens.

## Refresh Tokens

## Endpoints

This plugin adds the following endpoints to your Strapi application.

Since I didn't want to overwrite the Strapi login flow, the Refresh Token should be obtained after you log-in on register in the app by calling a specific endpoint for this with your credentials. Then you have to store the Refresh Token together with you user data and access token for future use.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Create a better admin screen for refresh tokens
- [ ] Create endpoint for the user to see its "sessions"
- [ ] Create plugin settings screen
